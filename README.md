# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Dashboard with Power BI

This repository contains a data analysis and visualization project focused on heart disease prediction using Power BI. The project uses clinical data to uncover insights and build an interactive dashboard to assist healthcare professionals and data analysts in understanding factors contributing to heart disease.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal is to analyze clinical features that influence heart disease and visualize them through an intuitive Power BI dashboard. While this project doesn't involve machine learning prediction directly in Power BI, it explores patterns in the data that can help in early diagnosis and awareness.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** [UCI Heart Disease Dataset via Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci)
- **Total Records:** ~300
- **Features:** 14 clinical attributes + target
## 📈 Dashboard Features

The Power BI report includes:

- Distribution of heart disease by age, sex, and chest pain type
- Correlation between maximum heart rate and heart disease
- Impact of cholesterol, resting blood pressure, and ST depression
- Interactive filters for gender, age group, and heart disease presence
- KPI cards and slicers for quick insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Power Query for data transformation**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for measures**
- **CSV dataset (Kaggle/UCI)**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-powerbi.git
cd heart-disease-powerbi

### 2. Open the Power BI File

Launch Power BI Desktop

Open reports/Heart_Disease.pbix

If prompted, re-load the dataset from data/heart_disease.csv

🧪 Insights Gained

Males over the age of 50 showed higher rates of heart disease

High cholesterol and low maximum heart rate are key risk indicators

Chest pain type and ST depression are strong predictors

✅ Future Enhancements

Integrate ML predictions (e.g., using Python/R scripts inside Power BI)

Deploy dashboard to Power BI Service for sharing and scheduling

Expand dataset with real-world hospital data (with privacy compliance)
